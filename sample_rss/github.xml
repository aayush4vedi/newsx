        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law">Benford's Law</a>, also called the Newcomb–Benford law, the law of anomalous numbers, or the first-digit law, is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to be small. For example, in sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5% of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1% of the time. Benford's law also makes predictions about the distribution of second digits, third digits, digit combinations, and so on.

                                                <p>Chatwoot is an open-source omnichannel customer support software. The development of Chatwoot started in 2016. It failed to succeed as a business and eventually shut up shop in 2017. During 2019 #Hacktoberfest, the maintainers decided to make it open-source, instead of letting the code rust in a private repo. With a pleasant surprise, Chatwoot became a trending project on Hacker News and best of all, got lots of love from the community. Now, a failed project is back on track and the prospects are looking great. The team is back to working on the project and this time, we are building it in the open. Thanks to the ideas and contributions from the community.</p>

Here we use Modelsim-SE (requires license) as our simulation tool. We do not recommend using the Modelsim-Altera_Start_Edition (Modelsim-ASE) -- the free version that comes with Quartus -- to simulate Pigasus, as Pigasus exceeds the line limit of Modelsim-ASE, which leads to extremely slow simulation. We have not tested other simulation tools like VCS.</p>

It uses Wine to facilitate this.</p>undefined<p>Most users will prefer to use Proton provided by the Steam client itself. The source code is provided to enable advanced users the ability to alter Proton. For example, some users may wish to use a different version of Wine with a particular title.</p>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Getting Started with Proton from Steam Play</h2>undefined<ul>undefined<li>As the new Steam Play is still in Beta, it is recommended that you opt into the undefined<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=182912431">Steam Client Beta</a> for the latest features and fixes.undefined</li>undefined<li>Proton requires graphics drivers that are more recent than what is typically packaged in most distributions; please read the undefined<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Requirements">list of requirements and quickstart for Ubuntu 18.04 users</a>undefined</li>undefined<li>Install and play games! Please refer to undefined<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/221410/announcements/detail/1696055855739350561">this post</a> for more information.undefined</li>undefined<li>Visit the undefined<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog">changelog</a> for information about recent updates.undefined</li>undefined</ul>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Obtaining Proton from source</h2>undefined<p>undefined<strong>NOTE:</strong> If you are not comfortable in a command line terminal, or if you find any of the information presented in here strange and uncomfortable, then this is probably not for you. The instructions are likely to be incomplete and require some knowledge and skill on your part, and there is no warranty or guarantee that anyone will help you with this process.undefined</p>undefined<p>We strongly recommend that most users use the production build of Proton.</p>undefined<p>The most current source for Proton is here: undefined<a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton">https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton</a>undefined</p>undefined<p>Which you can clone to your system with this command:</p>undefined<pre>undefined<code> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton.git proton cd proton </code>undefined</pre>undefined<p>If you wish to change any subcomponent, now is the time to do so. For example, if you wish make changes to Wine, you would apply those changes to the undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->wine/ undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted --> directory.undefined</p>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Easy build path</h2>undefined<p>Building Proton is quite complicated. We provide a top-level Makefile which will execute most of the build commands for you. This section describes how to use this Makefile for simple Proton builds.</p>undefined<p>This Makefile uses a virtual machine to create a consistent build environment. The VM is managed with undefined<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, which you will need to install before invoking these commands. Proton's build system is most well tested with Vagrant's VirtualBox and libvirt/qemu backends. It also requires the vagrant-sshfs plugin. You may run into problems with the shared folder (undefined<code>vagrant_share</code>) and/or CPU and memory usage with other backends.undefined</p>undefined<p>If your build VM gets cluttered, or falls out of date, you can use undefined<code>vagrant destroy</code> to wipe the VM clean, then invoke one of the below commands to start over.undefined</p>undefined<p>After checking out Proton and updating its submodules, you can use these targets to build Proton:</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make install</code> - This will install Proton into your user's Steam directory. You may need to restart the Steam client to see it. The tool's name in the Steam client will be based on the currently checked out branch of Proton. You can override this name using the undefined<code>build_name</code> variable.undefined</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make redist</code> - This will create a build which you can easily redistribute to other users. The package will be dropped into a new directory in undefined<code>vagrant_share/</code>, named after the nearest Git tag (see undefined<code>git describe</code>). Copying this directory into undefined<code>~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/</code> will make the build available after restarting the Steam client.undefined</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make deploy</code> - This will create a deployment tarball and set of files which can be distributed as a Proton package. This is what we use to deploy Proton to Steam users. The package will be dropped into a new directory in undefined<code>vagrant_share/</code>, named after the nearest Git tag (see undefined<code>git describe</code>).undefined</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make clean</code> - This will completely erase the build tree in the VM.undefined</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make help</code> - View the Makefile documentation and examples.undefined</p>undefined<p>We also provide targets useful for simple Wine development:</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make proton</code> - This will build Proton without copying its files out of the VM.undefined</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make module=&lt;module&gt; module</code> - This will build both 32- and 64-bit versions of the specified module, and copy the result into the undefined<code>vagrant_share</code> directory. This allows rapid iteration on one module. This target is only useful after building Proton.undefined</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make dxvk</code> - This will rebuild DXVK and copy it into undefined<code>vagrant_share</code>.undefined</p>undefined<p>If you are doing significant Wine development or want to control the build with more fine detail, see the full documentation below.</p>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Building</h2>undefined<p>At a high level, the build instructions are:</p>undefined<ol>undefined<li>Set up your build environment</li>undefined<li>Configure the build</li>undefined<li>Build Proton</li>undefined<li>Install Proton locally (optional)</li>undefined</ol>undefined<p>See below for more details on all of these steps. Please read all of the instructions before proceeding.</p>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Set up the build environment</h2>undefined<p>Proton has a lot of build-time dependencies. The following instructions describe how we create the build environment for the production builds of Proton. For reproducibility and security reasons, we will be setting up a Debian virtual machine. However, you should be able to follow these instructions on other distributions as well.</p>undefined<p>Proton provides a Vagrantfile, which will automatically set up the Debian VM for you. After installing undefined<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>, initialize the VM by running from within the Proton directory:undefined</p>undefined<pre>undefined<code> vagrant up </code>undefined</pre>undefined<p>It will take a long time to download and install the Steam runtime containers and so on. Eventually it will complete. You can SSH into the virtual machine with:</p>undefined<pre>undefined<code> vagrant ssh </code>undefined</pre>undefined<p>At this point you will need to configure the build directory. See below.</p>undefined<p>The Vagrantfile is set up to rsync the undefined<code>proton</code> directory into the VM on boot. On the host machine, you can use undefined<code>vagrant rsync-auto</code> to have Vagrant automatically sync changes on your host machine into the build machine. It is recommended that you make changes on your host machine, and then perform the build in the VM. Any changes you make in the undefined<code>proton</code> directory on the VM may be overwritten by later rsync updates from the host machine.undefined</p>undefined<p>The Vagrantfile also creates a directory called undefined<code>vagrant_share</code> in the undefined<code>proton</code> directory of your host machine, which is mounted at undefined<code>/vagrant</code> within the VM. You can use this shared folder to move your Proton build out of the VM, or as one way to copy files into the VM.undefined</p>undefined<p>When you are done with the VM, you can shut it down from the host machine:</p>undefined<pre>undefined<code> vagrant halt </code>undefined</pre>undefined<p>Please read the Vagrant documentation for more information about how to use Vagrant VMs.</p>undefined<p>If you do not wish to use Vagrant, you can read through both Vagrantfile and undefined<code>vagrant-user-setup.sh</code> for the list of dependencies and instructions on how to set up your own machine or another VM of your choosing. It is aimed at Debian 10, but you should be able to adapt them for other distributions.undefined</p>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Alternative: Building without the Steam Runtime</h2>undefined<p>The Steam Runtime provides a clean and consistent set of libraries. Software distributed through Steam should depend only on libraries available through the runtime, and so we build in that environment for production Proton builds. The Vagrantfile described above will set this up for you. However, if you are simply making a build for yourself, you may want to skip setting up the Steam runtime, as it takes a very long time to set up. To do this, edit the undefined<code>vagrant-user-setup.sh</code> script appropriately before running undefined<code>vagrant up</code>.undefined</p>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Configure the build</h2>undefined<p>After setting up the build system, it is time to run the configure script which will generate the Makefile to build your project. Run these steps. You may of course use whatever paths you like.</p>undefined<pre>undefined<code> mkdir build/ cd build ../proton/configure.sh --steam-runtime64=docker:steam-proton-dev --steam-runtime32=docker:steam-proton-dev </code>undefined</pre>undefined<p>If you are building without the Steam runtime, then instead use:</p>undefined<pre>undefined<code> ../proton/configure.sh --no-steam-runtime </code>undefined</pre>undefined<p>undefined<strong>Tip</strong>: If you are building without the Steam runtime, you should now run undefined<code>make obj-wine64/Makefile obj-wine32/Makefile</code> and check the files undefined<code>obj-wine64/config.log</code> and undefined<code>obj-wine32/config.log</code> for missing packages. Search for undefined<code>won't be supported</code>. A couple of missing packages are normal: undefined<code>opencv</code>, undefined<code>oss</code>. More than that may indicate a problem. Please see your distro's documentation to acquire the considerable build dependencies for Wine.undefined</p>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Build Proton</h2>undefined<p>A couple of Makefile targets are provided.</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make dist</code> will create a Proton installation in undefined<code>dist/</code> that you can install manually (see below), or automatically with undefined<code>make install</code>.undefined</p>undefined<p>undefined<code>make deploy</code> will package Proton up for distribution via Steamworks.undefined</p>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Install Proton locally</h2>undefined<p>Steam ships with several versions of Proton, which games will use by default or that you can select in Steam Settings's SteamPlay page. Steam also supports running games with local builds of Proton, which you can install on your machine. The undefined<code>install</code> target will perform the below steps for you.undefined</p>undefined<p>To install a local build of Proton into Steam, make a new directory in undefined<code>~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/</code> with a tool name of your choosing and place the contents of undefined<code>dist</code> into that folder. The undefined<code>make install</code> target will perform this task for you, installing the Proton build into the Steam folder for the current user. You will have to restart the Steam client for it to pick up on a new tool.undefined</p>undefined<p>A correct local tool installation should look like this:</p>undefined<pre>undefined<code> compatibilitytools.d/my_proton/ ├── compatibilitytool.vdf ├── filelock.py ├── LICENSE ├── proton ├── proton_dist.tar ├── toolmanifest.vdf ├── user_settings.sample.py └── version </code>undefined</pre>undefined<p>To enable your local build in Steam, go to the Steam Play section of the Settings window. If the build was correctly installed, you should see "proton-localbuild" in the drop-down list of compatibility tools.</p>undefined<p>Each component of this software is used under the terms of their licenses. See the undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->LICENSE undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted --> files here, as well as the undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->LICENSE undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->COPYING undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, etc files in each submodule and directory for details. If you distribute a built version of Proton to other users, you must adhere to the terms of these licenses.undefined</p>undefined<hr>undefined<h2>Runtime Config Options</h2>undefined<p>Proton can be tuned at runtime to help certain games run. The Steam client sets some options for known games using the undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->STEAM_COMPAT_CONFIG undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted --> variable. You can override these options using the environment variables described below.undefined</p>undefined<p>The best way to set these environment overrides for all games is by renaming undefined<code>user_settings.sample.py</code> to undefined<code>user_settings.py</code> and modifying it appropriately. This file is located in the Proton installation directory in your Steam library (often undefined<code>~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Proton #.#</code>).undefined</p>undefined<p>If you want to change the runtime configuration for a specific game, you can use the undefined<code>Set Launch Options</code> setting in the game's undefined<code>Properties</code> dialog in the Steam client. Set the variable, followed by undefined<code>%command%</code>. For example, input "undefined<code>PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%</code>" to use the OpenGL-based wined3d renderer instead of the Vulkan-based DXVK renderer.undefined</p>undefined<p>To enable an option, set the variable to a non- undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->0 undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted --> value. To disable an option, set the variable to undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->0 undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. To use Steam's default configuration, do not specify the variable at all.undefined</p>undefined<p>All of the below are runtime options. They do not effect permanent changes to the Wine prefix. Removing the option will revert to the previous behavior.</p>undefined<p>| Compat config string | Environment Variable | Description | | :-------------------- | :----------------------------- | :----------- | | | undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted -->PROTON_LOG undefined<!-- raw HTML omitted --> | Convenience method for dumping a useful debug log to undefined<code>$HOME/steam-$APPID.log</code>.

If the release version (i.e., the master branch) exhibits unexpected behaviour for your device and configuration, you should upgrade to the latest development version instead to see if your problem is resolved as some bugs in previous releases or development builds may already have been resolved.</p>undefined<p>The Tasmota development codebase is checked every 1-2 hours for changes. If new commits have been merged and they compile successfuly, new binary files for every variant will be posted at http://ota.tasmota.com/tasmota/ (this web address can be used for OTA updates too). It is important to note that these binaries are based on the current development codebase. These commits are tested as much as is possible and are typically quite stable. However, it is infeasible to test on the hundreds of different types of devices with all the available configuration options permitted.</p>undefined<p>Note that there is a chance, as with any upgrade, that the device may not function as expected. You must always account for the possibility that you may need to flash the device via the serial programming interface if the OTA upgrade fails. Even with the master release, you should always attempt to test the device or a similar prototype before upgrading a device which is in production or is hard to reach. And, as always, make a backup of the device configuration before beginning any firmware update.</p>undefined<h2>Disclaimer</h2>undefined<p>:warning: undefined<strong>DANGER OF ELECTROCUTION</strong> :warning:undefined</p>undefined<p>If your device connects to mains electricity (AC power) there is danger of electrocution if not installed properly.
